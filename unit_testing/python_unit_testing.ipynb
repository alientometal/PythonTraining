    "Since time immemorial we have known that mistakes are inherent to human nature. But the important thing is to learn from them and avoid repeating them. This is easier said than done, because for that we have to recognize beforehand that we are not perfect and have enough humility to accept it, as well as the determination to move forward. \n",
    "Taking this into account, we know that when developing a software solution we can make mistakes and to anticipate errors it is very useful to test before the code reaches production.\n",
    "Some of the main reasons for testing are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is absolutely essential to identify errors that have been made in the [development phases](https://www.docpath.com/art-the-importance-of-testing-your-software-development/).\n",
    "* It guarantees that the software is reliable and ensures customer satisfaction.\n",
    "* It guarantees the quality of the product, which ultimately leads to customer loyalty.\n",
    "* Reduces maintenance costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unit Tests\n",
    "It is a way to check that a set of functions or classes (as many as we want) work as we expect. Logically, unit tests can never completely guarantee the correct functioning of a piece of code. Nevertheless, they will be able to detect a lot of anomalies and save us debugging time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we will use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to perform the tests in a simpler way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integration Tests\n",
    "Integration tests verify that the different modules and/or services used by our application work in harmony when working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "They may test interaction with one or multiple databases, or ensure that microservices operate as expected.\n",
    "Integration tests are typically the next step after unit tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "And they are generally more expensive to run, as they require more parts of our application to be configured and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mocking\n",
    "In Object Oriented Programming (OOP), objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in a controlled way are called Mock. They are used to test other objects in unit tests that expect messages from a particular class for their methods, just as car designers use a crash dummy when simulating an accident. \n",
    "In unit tests, dummy objects are used to simulate the behavior of complex objects when it is impossible or impractical to use the real object in the test. Incidentally, it solves the problem of the case of interdependent objects, that in order to test the first one an untested object must be used, which invalidates the test: simulated objects are very simple to build and return a certain and directly implementable result, independently of the complex processes or interactions that the real object may have."
