    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In python it is possible to define functions and procedures (which are ultimately also objects). A function is a group of related statements that perform a specific task. Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and more complex, functions make it more organized and manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and a set of parentheses that can contain arguments. The code within the function must be indented and is executed when the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for defining a function in Python is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(arguments):\n",
    "    # code to be executed when the function is called\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then these functions can be grouped and converted into a library (these are code blocks with functions and objects that are called to access those functions).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to create a function, it will take a number and return the succession of fibonacci in that number:"
